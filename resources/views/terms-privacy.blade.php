                                    While we will always do what is safest for your pet, the removal of mats is a time consuming and sometimes dangerous process. If your pet is severely matted, we may be unable to save their coat without causing harm or discomfort. Therefore, customers who use our dematting service must give their consent to Groomit For Pets LLC to remove (shave down or spot shave) their pet's coat if necessary.<br>By agreeing, you release Groomit for Pets LLC from any and all liability for any skin conditions that might be revealed by the removal of the matted coat. You must understand that such pre-existing conditions are not the responsibility of Groomit for Pets LLC. Revealed medical conditions may require veterinary care and you will assume financial responsibility of any such expense.

                                    Groomit is responsible for providing our customers with high-quality groomers.  However it is possible that pets do not get along with certain groomers, If the groomer arrives at your location and the pet is seen as non-groomable you will be fully charged for the appointment due to the groomer’s loss of time in which they could have scheduled another appointment.

                        <p>We operate the Service solely as a platform that permits groomers and pet owners to interact. We
                        do not provide any grooming services. We will investigate any illegal and/or unauthorized uses
                        of the Service and we will take all legal action that we consider necessary or appropriate to
                        ensure that such activity is stopped.</p>

                        are solely responsible for your communication and interaction with other Users. If there is a
                        dispute between any Groomer and any Pet Owner, between any other Users, or between Groomer or
                        Pet Owner and any third party, We are under no obligation to become involved, and You hereby
                        release Groomit, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, demands
                        and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, including death, known or
                        unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way
                        related to such disputes and/or the Service. In the event that we are forced to be involved in
                        any such dispute, You agree that You shall be responsible for any and all legal fees and costs
                        we incur as a result of our involvement. If You are a California resident, You waive California
                        Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the
                        creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release,
                        which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
