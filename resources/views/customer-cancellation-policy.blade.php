                <p><strong>Non-groomable</strong></p>

                <p>Groomit is responsible for providing our customers with high-quality groomers.  However it is possible that pets do not get along with certain groomers, If the groomer arrives at your location and the pet is seen as non-groomable you will be fully charged for the appointment due to the groomer’s loss of time in which they could have scheduled another appointment.</p>
