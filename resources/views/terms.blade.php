                        dispute will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of
                        law provisions. You hereby submit to personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal
                        courts of the State of New York, City of Yonkers. Regardless of any statute or law to the
                        contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Groomit Service
                        or the TOU must be filed by You within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or

                        breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services
                        (collectively “Disputes”)will be settled by binding arbitration between You and Groomit, except
                        that each party retains the right to bring an action in small claims court and the righto seek
                        injunction to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a
                        party’s intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree you are waiving your right to
                        trial by jury. Any arbitration shall be in Yonkers, NY using the American Arbitration
                        Association commercial arbitration rules using a single arbitrator to be selected by Groomit.
                        The parties shall equally share the expenses associated with such Arbitration.

                        Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a
                        waiver of such right or provision. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of
                        the TOU invalid, the court should try to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
                        the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU will remain in full force and effect.
