                <p><strong>Injury to Dogs</strong></p>

                <p>While being a pet groomer can be very rewarding and potentially lucrative, this is the hands-down most challenging profession within the pet industry. The field presents the greatest potential for injuries and accidents—to pets and groomers alike. It is the groomer’s responsibility with specific add ons such as the anal gland and de-matting to inform the customer about the risks prior to grooming. This will help to avoid claims made by customers because they are now informed about the risks of certain procedures. It is also the groomer’s responsibility if pets are injured to inform our support team immediately.</p>

                <p><strong>Lateness</strong></p>

                <p>It is the company’s responsibility to provide customers with a high-quality experience. This includes groomers being on time for their appointment. If groomers are late for their appointment and customers are not satisfied, groomers will be notified after their appointment is completed. Customers will be given credit upon complaint and groomers will pay 50% of the payment. It is important to plan your schedule accordingly.</p>

                <p><strong>Grooming Quality </strong></p>
                
                <p>Customer service skills are extremely important for those hoping to meet the expectations of quality that customers expect. While you do spend the majority of time with the dogs, you have to be able to communicate clearly with each owner to determine exactly what cut they want for their dog. You also have to make the client feel valued and appreciated each time you visit their homes. It's important to demonstrate that their dog will be safe in your hands by reassuring the owner and showing respect for their pet. If customers complain about the quality of their cut, they will be given credit up to the full amount and the groomer will be charged 50% of that credit amount.

                <p>Another aspect of the high quality we give our customers is our cleanliness after the grooming. It is the groomer’s responsibility to leave the homes in good condition.</p>
